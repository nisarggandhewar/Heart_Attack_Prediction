# Heart_Attack_Prediction

# Objective
Main objective is to predict whether person suffer from heart attack or not

# Libraries used
Following libraries are used in this project.
1) Numpy
2) Pandas
3) Matplotlib
4) Seaborn
5) Scikitlearn

# Dataset
Here we have the description of the features:
age - age in years
sex - sex (0 = female; 1 = male)
cp - chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 0 = asymptomatic)
trtbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (0 = false; 1 = true)
restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = hypertrophy; 2 = having ST-T wave abnormality)
thalachh - maximum heart rate achieved
exng - exercise induced angina (0 = no; 1 = yes)
oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slp - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = downsloping; 1 = flat; 2 = upsloping)
caa - number of major vessels (0-4) colored by flourosopy
thall - thallium stress test (1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect; 3 = normal)
output - 0 = less chance of heart attack; 1 = more chance of heart attack

# Methodologies
1) Collection of Dataset
2) Performed Basic EDA : head(),tail(), info(), shape, describe()
3) Performed Advance EDA: Checking Null Value, Checking Duplicate Value, Handled Outliers, Encoding, Feature scaling, visualization
4) Seperate the Dependent and Independent variable
5) Seperate the dataset into train & test set
6) Apply different Classification Models : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost.
7) Performed comparative analysis of different classification algorithm.

# Visualization
Following are the some visualization generated in this case study
